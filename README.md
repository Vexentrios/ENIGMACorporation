# EncryptionCorporation
A small adventure-educational game about ciphers (Vigenere, Caesar, etc.)
On each level You need to solve what word has been encrypted, but luckly for You, there are tools, which You may use.
Also a piece of paper may be helpful too. _(Just saying)_

# Plot
ENIGMA CORPORATION is the organisation, specialized in cracking symetrical ciphers.
Their main enemy is mysterious group CIPHERION, which, since many years, attacks devices of users across the whole globe, They get pleasure from encryption of anything, what they laid their hands on.

Over the years, users became more aware and careful, thanks to security courses and education introduced at schools. Even tho CIPHERION, didn't stand still for the events taking place around them.
They set a goal to create a cipher, which will be impossible to crack, even for themselves. Sadly even their budget aren't limitless, and energy costs. Cause of that, they decided to create special software to get money, by the price of usage of user's devices.

That led to the global crisis, which even ENIGMA CORPORATION became victim.
CIPHERION decided to leave a security backdoor. Their software coud've been turned off and deleted, but only after entering access code. This code was encrypted by random encryption algorithm and was showed on user's device.
However it was blocking all tool or websites with decryption algorithms.
ENIGMA's main system got affected by the most complexed code, to which creation was used Enigma.

Probably You will ask, what You have to do with all of it?
You are a new recruit, applying for a job at ENIGMA CORPORATION, but You didn't expected, to be called to their Headquarters, when chaos is all around.
Will You be able to climb the ladder of the business and decrypt the main key, and by this maybe stop this whole crisis?
Maybe even You will find the truth, behind this how ENIGMA became a victim of... Enigma?
				Anyways, Good Luck!
